Brazillian Data Scientist borned in 1995.

In high school times, he suffered a lot to choose which path of study he would follow (A proof is that he tried medicine, made a year of engineering, and soon will end his bachelor's degree in law).

He desires to improve his skills, becoming one of the best Machine Learning Engineers in the world.

His biggest dream is to create a Social Project to bring education to all.
